## 💾 Data Storage (localStorage)

Currently using localStorage for rapid prototyping. Data structure:

- `projecthub_users` - User accounts
- `projecthub_profiles` - User profiles with role data
- `projecthub_groups` - Project groups
- `projecthub_mentor_forms` - Active allocation forms
- `projecthub_mentor_preferences` - Student submissions
- `projecthub_mentor_allocations` - Allocation status

### Ready for Supabase Migration

The `lib/storage.ts` file is designed as an abstraction layer. To migrate to Supabase:
1. Replace localStorage functions with Supabase queries
2. Keep the same function signatures
3. No changes needed in components

## 🔄 Group ID Generation

Groups get unique IDs based on department:
- Format: `{DEPT}{SERIAL}`
- Examples: `IT01`, `CS03`, `ECS12`
- Team codes: 5-character alphanumeric (e.g., `A7DXQ`)

## 🎯 Key Validation Rules

1. **Groups**:
   - Max 3 members
   - Same department only
   - Unique team codes

2. **Mentor Preferences**:
   - Exactly 3 mentors required
   - No duplicates
   - Leader-only submission
   - One submission per group

3. **Mentor Acceptance**:
   - Faculty can accept one team
   - Accepting one rejects others for that group

4. **Access Codes**:
   - Department-specific
   - Required for Super Admin only
   - Case-sensitive

## 🚧 Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Supabase integration for multi-user real-time features
- Project progress tracking
- Document uploads
- Meeting scheduling
- Evaluation forms
- Email notifications

## 📱 Responsive Design

Fully responsive layouts:
- Mobile: Stacked cards, full-width buttons
- Tablet: 2-column grids
- Desktop: Multi-column layouts with sidebars
